## Introduction

Solving PDEs using traditional numerical methods can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. PINNs offer an alternative approach that leverages the power of neural networks to solve PDEs using limited data. In this project, we demonstrate the use of PINNs for solving a variety of PDEs.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

The code in this repository is organized into subdirectories that correspond to different types of PDEs. To run a specific example, navigate to the relevant subdirectory and run the corresponding Jupyter notebook.
